					Task  : BrowserTask

					Create  a program that accepts browserName and operatingSystem as String and isBrowserOpened as boolean

				        If the Browser is closed, try to open the corresponding browsers in that operating system to run your code.


				        		=== These browsers can be opened in these operatingSystem ===

				                    chrome   		    --- > mac - windows
				                    chrome-headless 	--- > mac - windows
				                    firefox-headless    --- > mac - windows
				                    firefox             --- > mac - windows
				                    remote-chrome  		--- > mac - windows
				                    ie 					--- > windows
				                    edge 				--- > windows
				                    safari 			    --- > mac


				         - According to related browserName and operatingSystem it should give

				             OUTPUT -- > "Browser is opened successfully with $browserName in $operatingSystem"

				          - if operatingSystem does not support $browserName

				              OUTPUT -- > "Your $operatingSystem doesn't support $browserName"

				     If the Browser is already opened it should give an error message

				        	OUTPUT -- > "Browser is already opened with $browserName in $operatingSystem"
