            Task01:   Casting and Variables Practice

			Task02:   Aritmetic Operators

			            1.Create a class called GalonsToLiters, and write a program that can convert the gallons tto litters
                           Ex:
                              gallon = 10;
                              output:
                                    10 gallons equal to 37.8541 liters

                           Hint: 1 gallon = 3.78541 liters

						2.Create class named "TimeConverter" and make a main method

						- Write a Java program to convert time from second to hours/min/day format
						- Input Seconds : 3695


							Expected Output:
							inputSeconds is 3695
							1 hours 1 minutes 35 seconds
