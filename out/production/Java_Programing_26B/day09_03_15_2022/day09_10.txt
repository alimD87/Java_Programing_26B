Task 01 : Write a program that accepts start and end numbers. Given start and end
          numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to
          but not including end, so start=5 and end=10 yields [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

                Input:
                        start = 5    end = 10
                Output
                        int[] a → [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
                Input:
                        start = 11    end = 18
                Output
                        int[] b → [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]


Task 02 : Write a program that accepts an array and prints an array with the elements "rotated left”

		int[] x = {1,2,3};			 // = > [2,3,1]
		int[] y = {17,12,10,8};		 // = > [12,10,8,17]
		int[] a = {7,0,0}; 			 // = > [0,0,7]


Task 03 : Write a program that accepts string and prints multiple words in the string

        "knife, wooden spoons, plates, cups, forks, pan, pot, trash can, fridge, dish washer”

        output : wooden spoons
        		 trash can
         		 dish washer


Task 04 : Write a program that accepts String array.Count how many names have the same first and last letter

          				Input : "Anna", "Mike", "Aliya", "Donald", "Saim", "Remus", "Mehmet","Asya"

          				Output :    4

          			Small Task --> 	Find  the longest word at the same time  --> Donald

Task 05 :Website checker

         Given some urls determine how many .com, .org, and .edu websites there are.
         Also keep track of an ‘other’ category for websites that have a different domain

         Sample websites for an array:
         bing.com, wikimedia.org, twitter.com, amazonaws.com, japanpost.jp, mysql.com,
         nasa.gov, linkedin.com, ucla.edu, github.io, spotify.com, mozilla.org, nba.com,
         comcast.net, tamu.edu, utexas.edu,


Task 06 : Write a program that accepts and array. For each multiple of 10 in the given array, change all
          the values following it to be that multiple of 10, until encountering another multiple of 10.

           Input  :
           int[] newArray = {5, 4, 40, 1, 60, 2, 30, 34, 70, 43, 2,80,67};

           Output :         [5, 4, 40, 40, 60, 60, 30, 30, 70, 70, 70, 80, 80]

Task 07 :  Write a method that accepts an array and prints the total of the numbers in the
        array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the
        next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7).

            int[] x = {1,2,2} = > 5
            int[] y = {1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7} = > 5
            int[] a = {1,1,6,7,2} = > 4
            int[] b = {1,1,6,2} = > 2
            int[] c = {1,2,2,6,99,99,7,3,4} = > 12




CHALLENGE
Real Interview Task-->  Longest Repetitive Substring


    Write a program if some substring K that can be repeated N>1 times to produce the input string exactly as it appears.
    Your program should return longest substring K, and
    if there is none it should be return "There is no repetitive substring"

    		For Example is str ="abcababcababcab"  			   output should be abcab
    					   str ="abcdefabcdef"     			   output should be abcdef

    					   str ="abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef"    output should be abcdefabcdef
    					   str ="abcdefxabcdef"				   output should be "There is no repetitive substring"
